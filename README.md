# GEN_AI_GDG
Objective • Trained GPT-2 on poetry data for text generation; assessed embeddings against co-occurrence models.
•To implement and compare FCGAN and DCGAN models for image generation on the MNIST dataset.
Approach • Processed poetry corpus, fine-tuned GPT-2, and generated poems; evaluated embeddings via similarity.
•Built and trained FCGAN and DCGAN; compared generated images across epochs for model evaluation.
Impact •Generated stylistically coherent and meaningful poetry using GPT-2, demonstrating its creative potential.
•Demonstrated image generation of DCGAN and FCGAN, highlighting architecture-specific performance.
